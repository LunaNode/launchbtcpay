This is the code for btcpayserver launcher at https://launchbtcpay.lunanode.com

To run, simply:

	go run main.go

When a user requests to provision a VM, the webserver will read run.sh and
replace parameters with user-specified configuration. The resulting script will
be passed as a startup script to the VM, via cloud-init.
